      that feels intuitive, engaging, and visually pleasing. Good design combines structure 
      and aesthetics to deliver clear messages.

      Responsive design ensures that a website adapts to different devices, making content 
      accessible and easy to read on mobile phones, tablets, and desktops. By using proper 
      fonts, spacing, and line height, designers can create layouts that improve readability 
      and enhance the overall user experience.
